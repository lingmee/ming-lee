### Items required: Inventory

_**Small, Medium and Large Essence Pouches.**_
**Optional: Giant essence pouch.** OPTIONAL - you can enable it from plugin config.
A Rune pouch containing: Astrals, Laws and Cosmic runes (10k each lasts for ages).
### **_Equipment_**

Weapon:**Dust Batllestaff** (unlimited runes)
Amulet:**Seal of passage** (if dream mentor not completed, so u are able to bank)
Optiona: **Gracefull outfit** for less run % usage, some good shield to take less damage from suqahs (DFS or something, but it makes u use bit more stam potions)

### **_Bank_**

Make sure you remove the placeholders for your essence pouches and rune pouch.
Make sure your bank is full. Otherwise plugin sometimes deposits pouches to bank and gets stuck, filling bank and removing placeholders removes that possibility.

**Stamina Potions (1).** (1) dose staminas for the run energy recovery.
**Food of your choice.** Default in in cofig is monfish, so get em if u dont wanna change any settings. U can get the other food ID with developer tool or from the internet using sites like https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/item-search/
**Abyssal Book from the Dark Mage.** >makes the NPC contact dialogue shorter and its needed for the plugin to work, u also need to contact dark mage once manually before plugin can do it, since it uses the >visit last option

This is the inventory / bank setup wich u need to run plugin, u dont need own tab for items in the bank, i just have em on single tab to make it easier. Before launching the plugin just open the >ALL BANK TAB and scroll bank to the top, also make sure the withdraw quantity is set as 1 and not ALL or something else.
GIF below shows how it fixes the rune pouch and how the working plugins looks like (yes i know u saw my current rsn in the dialogue, if u report me im gonna stop playing with ur dads testicles üíØ, and ur daddy doesent want that )

### TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON PROBLEMS
1. Sometimes it gets stuck trying to bank next to the astral altar (Reason for this to happen is 95% of the time small lag, atm if the plugin tries to do said action (example teleport to moonclan) and the server lags and it doesent go throught, plugins moves automaticly to the next step, wich would be banking, but since u didnt teleport it just stand next to altar trying to bank
**FIX FOR THIS:** Use low latency worlds, dont download anything while u are using the plugin, mostly lag fucks it up.

2. Sometimes deposits whole inventory trying to fix the essence pouches
**FIX FOR THIS:** Before starting the plugin, remove placeholders for RUNEPOUCH and ALL 3or4 ESSENCE POUCHES and make ur bank full with the fillers (seen in step above in bank section) This way its impossible to bank anything to bank wich doesent have placeholder

3. Sometimes it gets ''stuck'' for small period of time in spot shown below, 99% of the time it doesent get stuck there more than 2-3 seconds, but sometimes it might stand there for 10 seconds or so, and u are getting usually molested by the suqah
**JUST A NOTE FOR LOWER COMBAT LVL / HP LEVEL ACCOUNTS THAT U MIGHT GET MOLESTED BY THE SUQAH IN THIS LOCATION**

For more advanced tips and tricks u might wanna join the discord servers and ask big boys for help, but please try and fix the problem atleast once or twice by urself before DM'ing mods and asking for help.
People are allways happy to help, but spoonfeeding most pepega people gets boring real quick üíØ.
